# Portfolio Project 2: Credit Card Transactions

## Some scripts I wrote that use the pandas and seaborn libraries to conduct analysis on my Discover card transactions over the past two years, and to more quickly track my spending.

#### - In the Discover Purcahses.ipynb file, I analyzed my past two years of credit card transactions to identify my highest spending by month, category, and transaction description.
#### - Discover's website doesn't allow for scraping with selenium, so manual download of updated data is necessary.
#### - On the current_month_discover_trans script, once the csv is downloaded and saved at my predetermined path, I run the Python script from Terminal to quickly see a cost breakdown for my current month to-date transactions.
