# CC-Transactions

## Some scripts I wrote that use the pandas library to conduct analysis on my Discover card transactions to more quickly track my spending.

### Discover's website doesn't allow for scraping with selenium, so manual download of updated data is necessary.
### On the current_month_discover_trans script, once the csv is downloaded and saved at my predetermined path, I can simply run the Python script from Terminal to see a cost breakdown.
